# Regenerate SSL certificate

To comply with the system-wide cryptographic policy of FUTURE, you will need 
to generate a replacement SSL certificate using an RSA key of 3072 bit length,
or longer. 

Before you create the updated SSL certificate, make a backup of your existing
certificate files.

`cp /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key.orig`{{execute T1}}

`cp /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt.orig`{{execute T1}}

Now that you have a backup of your original certificates, and could revert to
them if something unexpected happens, generate a new, replacement SSL
certificate and public key.  The new RSA certificate will use a public key
of of 3072 bits.

`openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:3072 -subj='/C=XX/O=Default' -keyout /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key -out /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt`{{execute T1}}

<pre class="file">
Generating a RSA private key
.......................................++++
....................+++
writing new private key to '/etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key'
-----
</pre>

Verify the bit-length of the key to confirm that it is 3072 bit.

`openssl x509 -in /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt -text | grep bit`{{execute T1}}

<pre class="file">
                RSA Public-Key: (3072 bit)
</pre>

Now that a new SSL certificate has been created using a larger public key, 
it complies with the requirements of the  FUTURE cryptographic policy.

> **NOTE:** It is recommended practice to use Certificate Authority (CA) issued
certificates.  If you were using a certificate from a Certificate Authority,
you would need to generate a new Certificate Signature Request (csr) and
submit it to your CA.  When you receive the signed certificate from your CA,
you would then position it, and update any configuration files needed to
reference it.
