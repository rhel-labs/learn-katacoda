# Remediating and rescanning against a profile

One of the many failed rules in the scan previously done was related to IPSec support. In this step, you will remediate a single failed rule related to IPSec support.

__NOTE__: Many of the remediations involve restarting the host, and the current demo environment does not support host reboots yet. Thus, this lab will 
focus only on remediating a single issue. 

On *Terminal 2* of the lab interface, re-scan the host passing the *--remediation* option to carry out an online remediation. Additionally, provide
the Rule ID from the previous step (*xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_package_libreswan_installed*) to remediate the specific rule. If no
Rule ID is provided, oscap attempts to remediate all the failed rules.

`oscap xccdf eval --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_pci-dss --remediate --fetch-remote-resources --results scan-xccdf-results.xml --rule xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_package_libreswan_installed /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml`{{execute T2}}

<pre class="file">
Title   Install libreswan Package
Rule    xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_package_libreswan_installed
Ident   CCE-80845-1
Result  fail

 --- Starting Remediation ---
Title   Install libreswan Package
Rule    xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_package_libreswan_installed
Ident   CCE-80845-1
Result  fixed
</pre>

To verify that the issue is remediated, re-run the previous command. Oscap only attempts to fix what is broken, so it will not remediate an already fixed rule. 

`oscap xccdf eval --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_pci-dss --remediate --fetch-remote-resources --results scan-xccdf-results.xml --rule xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_package_libreswan_installed /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml`{{execute T2}}

<pre class="file">
Title   Install libreswan Package
Rule    xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_package_libreswan_installed
Ident   CCE-80845-1
Result  Pass

 --- Starting Remediation ---
</pre>

The remediation starts but there is no work left to be done.
