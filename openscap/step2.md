# Displaying available profiles 

You can display all available profiles in the datastream file using the *openscap info* command. For this lab, you will be using the RHEL8 datastream file. 

`oscap info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml`{{execute T1}}

The output has several profiles including PCI-DSS, [DRAFT] DISA STIG, and ACSC Essential Eight.

>__NOTE:__ Each profile in the output has a title which describes the profile and corresponding Id. For this lab, we are interested in the PCI-DSS profile, and the corresponding Id is *xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_pci-dss*. 

A profile contains generic security recommendations that apply to all Red Hat Enterprise Linux installations and additional security recommendations that are specific to the intended usage of a system. To obtain information about a specific profile, specify the *--profile* option.

`oscap info --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_pci-dss /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml`{{execute T1}}
