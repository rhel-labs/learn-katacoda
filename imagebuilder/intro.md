# Goal:
After completing this scenario, users will be able to create customized Red Hat Enterprise Linux images using Image Builder plugin within Web Console.

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Creating a custom blueprint to use for machine image creation
* Building a custom Red Hat Enterprise Linux machine image
* Monitoring the image build process

# Example Usecase:
Using Image Builder to make system images would be a consistent, repeatable
way to build the same installed system, but output the image to different
cloud formats for use in a hybrid cloud environment.
