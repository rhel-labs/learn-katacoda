# Navigate to Image Builder application
After logging into the Web Console, you are probably already looking at the 
Image Builder tab.  If, instead, you are looking at the *Host* tab, navigate 
to the Image Builder tab, as shown below:

![Navigate to Image Builder](./assets/Nav-ImageBuilder.png)

Because you have not used Image Builder before, you will need to start the
back-end service by clicking the *Start* button.  Notice that the 
*Automatically start osbuild-composer on boot* is selected, which means the 
service will automatically start after this whenever the system is booted.

Now that the back-end service has been started, you will notice that the
application screen updates and you can now *Create Blueprint*, which is
what you will do on the next step.
