# Goal:
After completing this scenario, users will be able to use Ansible playbooks 
to install and configure Microsoft SQL Server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Verify whether ansible is installed on the system
* Downloading the ansible role for SQL Server from ansible galaxy
* Viewing and editing the ansible playbook variables
* Running the playbook to install and configure Microsoft SQL Server on RHEL 8
* Login to SQL Server and query a table

# Example Use case:
Your IT team requires a uniform and streamlined way to install Microsoft SQL Server
across multiple RHEL servers. The SQL Server instances must also be setup using a uniform 
configuration, and the installation process must be repeatable when more servers
come online.
