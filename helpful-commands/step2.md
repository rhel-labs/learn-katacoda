# Viewing the end of log files with `tail`

Some files are large enough that it is not practical to display their contents
with `cat`. A common example is log files, which are often packed full of
information.

Since this only displays the last ten lines of a file, it is particularly
useful for viewing recent entries in log files. Take a look at the final
ten lines of the _boot_ log.

`tail /var/log/boot.log`{{execute T1}}

<pre class=file>
Starting Enable periodic update of entitlement certificates....
Starting Dynamic System Tuning Daemon...
Starting Network Manager Wait Online...
Starting Hostname Service...
[  OK  ] Started Enable periodic update of entitlement certificates..
[  OK  ] Started Permit User Sessions.
Starting Hold until boot process finishes up...
Starting Terminate Plymouth Boot Screen...
[  OK  ] Started Command Scheduler.
[  OK  ] Started OpenSSH server daemon.
</pre>

If you wish to then see the entire file, a text viewer like `less` or `view`
will let you view the entire file.

Adding the `-f` option will follow the log file so that you can see new entries.
Run this command in Terminal 2 to open an updating view of the _messages_ log, which
will display system information:

`tail -f /var/log/messages`{{execute T2}}

<pre class=file>
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>

</pre>

The `logger` utility will write to this _messages_ log. From the original terminal,
write to this log:

`logger Hello World`{{execute T1}}

Check that this message was recorded by returning to Terminal 2, where `tail` is
following the contents of this log:

` `{{execute T2}}

<pre class=file>
Jul 15 22:39:06 6d5380e16498 dnf[3679]: Metadata cache created.
Jul 15 22:39:06 6d5380e16498 systemd[1]: dnf-makecache.service: Succeeded.
Jul 15 22:39:06 6d5380e16498 systemd[1]: Started dnf makecache.
Jul 15 22:42:07 6d5380e16498 root[3693]: Hello World
</pre>

The message you just sent with `logger` is present in _messages_.

>_NOTE:_ If it took you a bit to switch back to Terminal 2, there may be additional
entries in the _messages_ log below your "Hello World".

Leave this `tail -f` process running in Terminal 2, you will use it again in
an upcoming step. The next step will walk you through locating files.
