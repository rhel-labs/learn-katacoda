# Viewing processes

Just as files organize how data is stored on Linux, processes organize all of the
programs that are running on the system. The `ps` command (short for Process
Status) will display information about the processes running in the current shell.
To see all of the processes running on the system and present them in a
user-readable format, it is common to add the `aux` options to `ps`.

`ps aux`{{execute}}

>_NOTE:_ There is another lab which goes into depth about `ps` and process
management. For more info on using `ps` (including how to end processes), check
out the [Service Administration Basics lab](https://lab.redhat.com/service-admin)

The output of this command is often very lengthy, so this is a great chance
to apply what you just learned a few steps ago. Using the pipe operator (`|`),
pipe the output of `ps aux` into the `grep` command to search for a specific
process. Search for the `tail -f` process that you started in step 2:

`ps aux | grep tail`{{execute T1}}

<pre class=file>
root       10046  0.0  0.0   7344   928 pts/1    S+   19:26   0:00 tail -f /var/log/messages
root       10051  0.0  0.0  12136  1136 pts/0    S+   19:26   0:00 grep --color=auto tail
</pre>

Here the search finds the `tail -f` process, but the second line of this output
shows that the search also finds itself.

`ps` is great for showing a snapshot of the active processes and their
resource usage, but sometimes it is more useful to have a utility that keeps
updating this information in real time. `top` does just that.

// provide detail on the top preamble
// brief summary of each, combine similar entries (i.e. memory, etc)

`top`{{execute T3}}

In addition to the process info, `top` includes some status information:
* The system uptime,
* Total number of user accounts
* 1 minute, 5 minute, and 15 minute load averages
* The total number of tasks and a breakdown of their status counts
* The kinds of tasks using the CPU
* A breakdown of memory and swap usage 

>_NOTE:_ For more information on the `top` preamble, visit section 2 of the [top man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/top.1.html).

This output will continue updating until you quit `top`, making it particularly
useful for diagnosing issues that change over time. Leave `top` running in this
terminal for now, you will return to it later.
