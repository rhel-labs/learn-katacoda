# Goal:
After completing this scenario, users will be able to create customized Red Hat Enterprise Linux images using the `composer-cli` command.

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Creating a custom blueprint to use for machine image creation
* Building a custom Red Hat Enterprise Linux machine image
* Monitoring the image build process
* Validate the completed machine image

# Example Usecase:
Using the Image Builder commandline interface to make system images would be a 
consistent, repeatable, automatable way to build the same machine images, but 
output the image to different cloud formats for use in a hybrid cloud 
environment.
