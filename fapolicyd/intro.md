# Goal:
After completing this scenario, users will be able to deploy and manage application control on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 systems.

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Install the File Access Policy Daemon (fapolicyd)
* Verify fapolicyd configuration
* Create a file-based trust database
* Configure integrity checking for fapolicyd

# Example Usecase:
In this lab, you are going to configure application control for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 systems. Application control is a security approach designed to protect against unauthorized process execution on systems. When implemented correctly, application control helps mitigate the risk of malicious code (malware), such as ransomware. 

Application control is recognised by the Australian Signals Directorate as one of the most effective mitigation strategies in ensuring the security of systems. It is a recommended strategy included in the Australian Signals Directorate's (Essential Eight)[https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/implementing-application-control] mitigation strategies, as well as the National Security Agency's (NSA) (Top Ten CyberSecurity Mitigation strategies)[https://www.nsa.gov/portals/75/documents/what-we-do/cybersecurity/professional-resources/csi-nsas-top10-cybersecurity-mitigation-strategies.pdf].
