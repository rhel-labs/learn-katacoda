After completing this scenario, you will be able to run container images and generate SELinux profiles customized 
for your container usecase using Udica

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Query the allow rules in the SELinux policy for the running container
* Use Udica to generate SELinux security profiles for the container 
* Apply policy modules to the container based on the Common Intermediate Language (CIL) file generated by Udica
* Re-query the allow rules in the SELinux policy for the running container to ensure that actions are allowed

# Example Usecase:
The default container type (container_t) is too restricted for certain usecases. For example, if Apache wants to read or write 
to the home directory, it is restricted by default. Similarly, container_t is too loose for other cases. For example, the application 
in the container can bind to any network port. Using udica can help you write a new SELinux security profiles that are customized for 
your container usecase, and does not require deep SELinux expertise to craft.
