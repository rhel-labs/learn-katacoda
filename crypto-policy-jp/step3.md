# Reconcile service issues

You will need to restart the Apache service after changing the system-wide
crypto policy so that it runs under the new policy.   

> **NOTE:** Red Hat recommends rebooting the system for all services to be
initialized with the new cryptographic policy, however, for this exercise you
will be individually working with the Apache web service.

`systemctl restart httpd.service`{{execute T1}}

<pre class="file">
Job for httpd.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
See "systemctl status httpd.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.
</pre>

The Apache service fails to restart.  You can see a more specific error 
message in the SSL error log for Apache.  You will further diagnose this
using the error messages from the command below and reconcile this in 
additional steps in the exercise.

`tail -2 /var/log/httpd/ssl_error_log`{{execute T1}}

<pre class="file">

From the log data, the error causing Apache to not start is caused by the
/etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt file.  Recall from the first step, Validate 
the Environment, that this file contained an RSA certificate that used a 2048 
bit public key.  However, due to the new FUTURE policy, RSA certificates now
require a public key of at least 3072 bits.

The FUTURE system-wide crypto policy is stopping Apache from starting because
running with the existing certificate, and public key, would violate the policy
settings.  In the next steps, you will resolve this issue.
