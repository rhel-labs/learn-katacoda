# Using  for system metrics

>**NOTE:** In this step we will be using the *pcp* terminal to run PCP commands. 

Select the *pcp* terminal to run commands in this step.

## Inspect the PCP configuration on the host

To inspect the PCP configuration and view a summary of the current PCP installation use the `pcp` command

`pcp`{{execute T2}}

Performance Co-Pilot configuration on be5455ac10c4:

 platform: Linux be5455ac10c4 4.18.0-240.el8.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Sep 23 05:13:10 EDT 2020 x86_64

<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
</pre>

The output shows the two main underlying components of PCP : __PCP's Collector Daemon (PMCD)__ which organizes, collects, manages metric information, and the __Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDAs)__ which knows how to gather information for different services. The file paths for __pmlogger__ (which archives logs of performance metric values) and __pmie__ (inference engine for performance metrics) are also shown in the output.

## Available PCP Kernel metrics ##
PCP can collect and show a host of different system kernel metrics.

Display the kernel metrics on the host with a short description using `pminfo` :

`pminfo -t kernel.all`{{execute T2}}

<pre class="file">
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
kernel.all.nprocs [total number of processes (lightweight)]
kernel.all.pid_max [maximum process identifier from /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max]
kernel.all.cpu.user [total user CPU time from /proc/stat for all CPUs, including guest CPU time]
kernel.all.cpu.nice [total nice user CPU time from /proc/stat for all CPUs, including guest time]
kernel.all.cpu.sys [total sys CPU time from /proc/stat for all CPUs]
kernel.all.cpu.idle [total idle CPU time from /proc/stat for all CPUs]

Check out `man pminfo` if you are interested in more details about the `pminfo` tool.

## Monitoring performance using PCP ##

The `pmrep` utility takes any of the available metrics and reports them in ASCII tables.

The command reports idle processor utilization for each CPU on the host, every 1 seconds in a 5 seconds window :

`pmval -t 1 -T 5 kernel.percpu.cpu.idle`{{execute T2}}

>**NOTE:** In the command above, if the hostname is not specified, it defaults to using `localhost`. By using the -h option, you can specify the hostname of a remote host to monitor for the specific metric.

<pre class="file">
metric:    kernel.percpu.cpu.idle
host:      ae6a0554552e
semantics: cumulative counter (converting to rate)
units:     millisec (converting to time utilization)
samples:   6
interval:  1.00 sec

              cpu0                  cpu1    
               0.9694                0.9894 
               0.9693                0.9993 
               0.9692                0.9892 
               0.9692                0.9891

We will use the `pmval` tool to monitor SQL Server performance in a later step.
