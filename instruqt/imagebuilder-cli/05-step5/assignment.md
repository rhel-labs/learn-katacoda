# Troubleshooting a compose

```
composer-cli compose log $(composer-cli compose status | head -n1 | cut -f1 -d" ")
```

Throughout the lab, you have seen the UUID of the compose transaction used in
command output and as an argument for working with individual machine image
operations.  The osbuild-composer back-end also uses this UUID to store data about
this, specific, machine image build.

To look at the data associated with the machine image build you completed in the lab -

```
composer-cli compose results $(composer-cli compose status | head -n1 | cut -f1 -d" ")
```

The output is a .tar that includes the logs, status, and resulting image.

To view the contents of the tar file -

```
tar -tvf $(composer-cli compose status | head -n1 | cut -f1 -d" ").tar
```
