# Create a blueprint from a file

First, look at what blueprints are available on the system.

```
composer-cli blueprints list
```

This system has no existing blueprints. So, let us go ahead and create a blueprint.

The `composer-cli` will take as input a TOML formatted file (Tom's Obvious Minimal Language)
that describes the blueprint used to define our machine image.

To save  some time look at the __node-app-server.toml__ file that has already been pre-created using a tool
like `cat` or `less`.

```
cat node-app-server.toml
```

<pre class='file'>
name = "node-app-server"
description = "Sample image for the node.js application server"
version = "0.0.1"
modules = []
groups = []
</pre>

The name of the blueprint is called __node-app-server__. It is recommended that you also include a description so that
others using this blueprint know what system image they are building. At this point, the blueprint file does not have
any packages but we will add the `nodejs` and `nginx` packages to it.

`nodejs` is distributed as an application stream for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, so you will need to add a __[[packages]]__
section to the node-app-server.toml file adding `nodejs` to the build.

```
printf '\n[[packages]]\nname = "nodejs"\nversion = "*"' >> node-app-server.toml
```

The `printf` command appends the following formatted stanza to the node-app-server.toml file.

<pre class='file'>
[[modules]]
name = "nodejs"
version = "*"
</pre>

Similarly, add the `nginx` package to the blueprint file.

```
printf '\n[[packages]]\nname = "nginx"\nversion = "*"' >> node-app-server.toml
```

In order to create the blueprint from the local TOML file, we will use the `blueprints push` cli option.

```
composer-cli blueprints push node-app-server.toml
```

To verify that your update has been made, review the log of changes made
to the node-app-server blueprint.

```
composer-cli blueprints changes node-app-server
```

<pre class='file'>
node-app-server
    2020-07-13T23:07:57Z  e4284083bad43ded8a4a9ea2947a5f45be72f8c4
    Recipe node-app-server, version 0.0.1 saved.
</pre>


>**Note:** in the above command output, your date and time will be different than the date and time that appears in the example output.

You can also review the contents of the node-app-server blueprint to verify
that the `nodejs` and `nginx` modules are reflected in the active version of the
blueprint instructions.

```
composer-cli blueprints show node-app-server
```

<pre class='file'>
name = "node-app-server"
description = "Sample image for the node.js application server"
version = "0.0.1"
modules = []
groups = []

[[packages]]
name = "nodejs"
version = "*"

[[packages]]
name = "nginx"
version = "*"
</pre>

In the above output, you can see that the `nodejs` and `nginx` packages are now
included in the node-app-server blueprint definition.
