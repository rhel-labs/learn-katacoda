# Building a machine image

Use the `composer-cli` command to start a compose based on the
node-app-server blueprint.  For this lab, you will use the output format
of __qcow2__. However, you could build any of the following types of images:

| Output type      |  Details                |
|------------------|:-----------------------:|
| ami              |  Amazon EC2             |
| openstack        |  OpenStack image        |
| qcow2            |  qcow2 image            |
| rhel-edge-commit |  RHEL edge image        |
| tar              |  tar archive            |
| vhd              |  virtual hard disk      |
| vmdk             |  Virtual Machine disk   |


```
composer-cli compose start node-app-server qcow2
```

<pre class='file'>
Compose 00403772-ff12-43d4-b09a-bddf28f20709 added to the queue
</pre>

The compose, or build of the image, is tracked using a UUID, in the above
example output, 00403772-ff12-43d4-b09a-bddf28f20709.  Your UUID should be
different and unique to your build.

Composes are queued and completed in the order that they were received.  You
can look at the status of the queue using `composer-cli compose status`.

```
composer-cli compose status
```
<pre class='file'>
00403772-ff12-43d4-b09a-bddf28f20709 RUNNING  Tue Feb 16 16:21:08 2021 node-app-server 0.0.1 qcow2
</pre>

The status will display all queued (WAITING), running (RUNNING), and
completed (FINISHED) composes.
