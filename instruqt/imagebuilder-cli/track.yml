title: Design and build virtual machine images using commandline tools [Image Builder]
description: |+
  # Goal:
  After completing this scenario, users will be able to create customized Red Hat Enterprise Linux images using the `composer-cli` command.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Creating a custom blueprint to use for machine image creation
  * Building a custom Red Hat Enterprise Linux machine image
  * Monitoring the image build process
  * Validate the completed machine image

  # Example Usecase:
  Using the Image Builder commandline interface to make system images would be a
  consistent, repeatable, automatable way to build the same machine images, but
  output the image to different cloud formats for use in a hybrid cloud
  environment.
