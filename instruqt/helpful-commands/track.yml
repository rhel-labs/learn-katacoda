title: Helpful Linux Commands [Admin 101]
description: |
  # Overview:

  Faced with a blinking cursor on your command line, Linux can be intimidating to
  new users who do not know where to start. This lab is designed to show you a
  series of must-know commands that will prove useful on all facets of system
  administration, from finding files to checking the status of system resources.

  # Goal:

  Build a toolbox of basic commands useful to every Linux user.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Viewing file contents with `cat`
  * Viewing the last 10 lines of a file with `tail`
  * Appending command outputs to a file with the `>>` operator
  * Locating files that match certain criteria using `find` and `locate`
  * Using `grep` with other commands to isolate a portion of their output
  * Checking disk space with `df`
  * Viewing and managing processes with `ps` and `top`
  * Using `free` to view information about the system memory usage
