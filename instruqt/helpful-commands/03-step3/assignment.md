# Locating files

Manipulating files is only useful if you can locate the file you need. This step
will walk you through two commands that are useful for this, `locate` and `find`.

The `find` command is great for searching for files which
satisfy some specified criteria. This step will show an example using the filename,
but you can also use it to look for files with certain permissions, empty files,
or much more.

```
find / -name messages
```

<pre class=file>
/var/log/messages
</pre>

The output is the full path to the file. If there are multiple matches, then
this output would have multiple lines and it would be up to the user
to decide which is the appropriate file. Instead of having to search through
countless directories, you can quickly locate the file.

>_Note:_ An in-depth explanation of using `find` to sort by file permissions
is included in the [File Permissions Basics lab](https://lab.redhat.com/file-permissions).

`find` can be input/output intensive, which can sap system resources, especially
if you run a search that will scan a large amount of candidate files. In fact,
the search above is exactly that kind of search, since it is looking for filenames
starting from the root directory. It will check every
single file on the entire system to see if it is a match.
The `locate` command instead queries a database to avoid being too I/O intensive.

```
locate messages
```

<pre class=file>
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
/usr/share/vim/vim80/syntax/messages.vim
/usr/share/vim/vim80/syntax/msmessages.vim
/var/log/messages
</pre>

This command finds a variety of files containing _messages_ in their name,
including the log file that you are looking for, `/var/log/messages`.
The database that `locate` uses to optimize the search process
is updated once per day by default, so that means if you are trying to
locate a newly created file it will not be present in the database.

Create a new file with `touch`:

```
touch newFile
```

Try to find this newly created file using `locate`:

```
locate newFile
```

There will be no output, as _newFile_ is not in the `locate` database.
Update the `locate` database using the `updatedb` command:

```
updatedb
```

Re-run the `locate` command to look through the newly updated database:

```
locate newFile
```

<pre class=file>
/root/newFile
</pre>

Now the file is present. This is important to keep in mind so that you do not
run into the frustrating situation where `locate` failed to find a file that
existed all along.
