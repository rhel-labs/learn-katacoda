# Viewing the end of log files with `tail`

Some files are large enough that it is not practical to display their contents
with `cat`. A common example is log files, which are often packed full of
information.

Since `tail` only displays the last ten lines of a file, it is particularly
useful for viewing recent entries in log files. Take a look at the final
ten lines of the _boot_ log.

```
tail /var/log/boot.log
```

<pre class=file>
Starting Enable periodic update of entitlement certificates....
Starting Dynamic System Tuning Daemon...
Starting Network Manager Wait Online...
Starting Hostname Service...
[  OK  ] Started Enable periodic update of entitlement certificates..
[  OK  ] Started Permit User Sessions.
Starting Hold until boot process finishes up...
Starting Terminate Plymouth Boot Screen...
[  OK  ] Started Command Scheduler.
[  OK  ] Started OpenSSH server daemon.
</pre>

If you wish to then see the entire file, a text viewer like `less` or `view`
will show the entire file.

Adding the `-f` option will follow the log file so that you can see new entries.
Run this command in Terminal 2 to open an updating view of the _messages_ log, which
will display system information:

```
tail -f /var/log/messages
```

<pre class=file>

The `logger` utility will write to this _messages_ log. From the original terminal,
write to this log:

```
logger Hello World
```

Check that this message was recorded.
```
tail /var/log/messages
```

<pre class=file>

The message you just sent with `logger` is present in _messages_.
