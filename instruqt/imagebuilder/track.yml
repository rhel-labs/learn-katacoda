description: |+
  # Goal:
  After completing this scenario, users will be able to create customized Red Hat Enterprise Linux images using Image Builder plugin within Web Console.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Creating a custom blueprint to use for machine image creation
  * Building a custom Red Hat Enterprise Linux machine image
  * Monitoring the image build process

  # Example Usecase:
  Using Image Builder to make system images would be a consistent, repeatable
  way to build the same installed system, but output the image to different
  cloud formats for use in a hybrid cloud environment.
