title: Service Administration Basics [Admin 101]
description: |
  # Overview:

  Services are processes that run in the background of a system, out of the userâ€™s view. They typically lack an interface and therefore have to be interacted with using commands. Services streamline the user experience by taking care of operations automatically and in a way that does not distract the user. There is actually a service that manages the starting and stopping of other services, `systemd`. This lab provides the basics of starting and stopping services using `systemctl`, which is the command that allows users to interact with the `systemd` service.

  # Goal:

  After completing this lab, users will understand how to start, restart, and stop a service. You will also learn how to make a service start every time the system starts.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:

  * View and kill processes
  * Learn how processes and services are related
  * View the status of a service
  * Learn how `systemd` and `systemctl` are related
  * Enable a service with `systemctl` to make it persistent
  * Restart a service to activate configuration changes
