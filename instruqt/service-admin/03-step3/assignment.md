# What is a service?

The process you interacted with in the previous step was a foreground process.
It ran in a terminal window where you could see it. Some processes run in the
background, out of view of the user. These background processes allow the
system to carry out many operations in parallel. Background processes that
continuously carry out a set of actions are called _services_.

_Daemons_ are even more specialized. These are services that
and are specifically designed to supervise or support other processes. Typically,
daemons are denoted by a __d__ at the end of their name. For example, __firewalld__
is the daemon which handles firewall functionality. These daemons lie in wait,
listening for the user to issue a command to tell them to change their behavior.

# Viewing the status of a service

__firewalld__ is a service which manages what network traffic to let into the system.
Check the status of the __firewalld__ service with the following command:

```
systemctl status firewalld.service --no-pager
```

<pre class=file>
‚óè firewalld.service - firewalld - dynamic firewall daemon
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/firewalld.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
</pre>

From this status message it is clear that the __firewalld__ service is installed
and active. But what is managing this service? It turns out that another service,
__systemd__, is in charge of managing all of the services on the system.

# __systemd__ vs. __systemctl__

When researching service management, you will come across two very similar terms:
__systemd__ and __systemctl__. These are very closely related.
__systemd__, short for system daemon, manages the state of the system and any
services running on it. Since __systemd__ is a daemon, it runs in the background
and needs a set of commands for users to interact with it. __systemctl__ provides
these commands. The `systemctl status` command above is one example of this,
and the upcoming steps will walk you through starting and enabling a service
with __systemctl__.
