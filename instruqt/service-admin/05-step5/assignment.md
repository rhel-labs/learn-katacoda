# Restarting a service to apply configuration changes

To demonstrate how configuration changes behave when a service is already running,
add an export directory to the NFS service on this system:

```
echo "/home" >> /etc/exports
```

This command adds the home directory to the export list configuration file for
NFS. Changing this config file does not lead to any immediate changes in the
NFS service, though. Print the export list again to confirm this:

```
showmount -e
```

<pre class=file>
Export list for rhel:
</pre>

To bring configuration changes into the service, you must first use `systemctl`
to restart it:

```
systemctl restart nfs-server
```

Now the configuration files have been re-read and NFS reflects the
configuration change.

```
showmount -e
```

<pre class=file>
Export list for rhel:
/home *
</pre>

The home directory is now listed as an exported drive that is available to
all NFS clients. If you ever run into a scenario where you are unable to see
configuration changes, make sure you check whether or not you have restarted
the service and reloaded the config files.
