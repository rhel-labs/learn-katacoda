# Killing processes

Now that you found the `dd` process on Terminal 1, terminate it using the `kill`
command. You would typically just manually enter the process ID after `kill`.
The process ID is the second column of the `ps aux` output from before.
However, to make this command clickable for each new lab instance the `pidof`
(__P__rocess __ID of__) command is used to automatically find the process ID.

```
kill $(pidof dd)
```

There is no output, but switching back to Terminal 2
reveals that the `dd` process has been terminated.

<pre class=file>
Terminated
</pre>

The `kill` command can send a variety of signals. Calling the command without
any options will default to `-SIGTERM`. This command will inform the process
that it is time for it to stop, but allow it to run any cleanup procedures that
it has. This often takes the form of closing files and freeing memory. In this
sense, `-SIGTERM` is the graceful option for terminating a process.

If you instead use the `kill -SIGKILL` command, this will instruct the kernel to
immediately stop the process. This prevents any cleanup that may have otherwise
occurred, leaving memory allocated and potentially leading to corrupted files.
Therefore, only use `-SIGKILL` as a last resort.

>_NOTE:_ You will also see the `kill` signals referred to numerically. `-SIGTERM`
is equivalent to `-15` and `-SIGKILL` is equivalent to `-9`.
