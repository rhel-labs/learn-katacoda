- assignment: '# Accessing documentation using `man`


    `man` is the command to access manual pages on Linux. These tell you how to

    use specific commands, programs, and conventions on your system, so knowing

    how to efficiently use the `man` command will save you time during research

    and troubleshooting. However, if you do not know how to leverage the `man`

    command, you may be discouraged from using this resource altogether.


    The contents are divided up into nine sections. You can find more information

    on these sections in the [Enable Sysadmin article](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/top-five-man-options)
    on `man` pages.


    Within these sections, each page has a name. The name of the page is how you

    can access the information within it. But what do you do if you don''t know the

    name of a page?


    The first time you try to list `man` pages, you will need to update your `man`

    database. Use the following command:


    `mandb`{{execute T1}}


    <pre class=file>

    << OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>


    113 man subdirectories contained newer manual pages.

    3220 manual pages were added.

    0 stray cats were added.

    0 old database entries were purged.

    </pre>


    >_NOTE:_ If the database has not been updated, you will get an output similar
    to

    ".: nothing appropriate."


    Once you have updated the `man` database, the following command

    will list all `man` pages available on your system:


    `man -k .`{{execute T1}}


    <pre class=file>

    << OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>


    zgrep (1)            - search possibly compressed files for a regular expression

    zless (1)            - file perusal filter for crt viewing of compressed text

    zmore (1)            - file perusal filter for crt viewing of compressed text

    znew (1)             - recompress .Z files to .gz files

    zramctl (8)          - set up and control zram devices

    zsoelim (1)          - interpret .so requests in groff input

    </pre>


    This list can be quite extensive, though, so you may want to pipe (`|`) the output

    into `less` or another text viewer.


    If you aren''t sure exactly what a page contains, the `-f` option will

    print a short description for the specified page.


    `man -f grep`{{execute T1}}


    <pre class=file>

    grep (1)             - print lines matching a pattern

    </pre>


    One thing that is essential for every Linux user to learn

    is tab completion. Tab completion allows you to press the _tab_ key

    to fill in the rest of the characters of the current item that you

    are typing. This will only complete if you have typed enough

    characters to uniquely identify one item that is available. If what

    you have typed so far is not unique, then nothing will happen on the

    first tab press. The second time you press tab, a list of options that

    match the string you have entered will be printed.

    Because of this, tab completion saves time and cuts down on mistakes.


    You could try tab completion for yourself by re-typing the previous command, but

    instead of typing `grep` all the way out, just type `gre` and then press tab.

    You will see that `grep` fills in, and you can hit enter to execute the command.


    These commands work great if you know the title of the `man` page that you

    are looking for, but what if you want to search for specific contents instead?

    `man` supports a `--regex` option that lets you search through all man pages

    using regular expressions. This will then open each page that contains a match

    sequentially. If you instead wish to just output the location of the matches,

    you can use the `-wK` options to return __w__here __k__eywords are

    located. Say you were looking for information on the chrony daemon:


    `man -wK chronyd`{{execute T1}}


    <pre class=file>

    /usr/share/man/man1/chronyc.1.gz

    /usr/share/man/man8/systemd-timedated.service.8.gz

    /usr/share/man/man8/chronyd.8.gz

    /usr/share/man/man5/chrony.conf.5.gz

    </pre>


    Then, if you decided you were looking for the `man` page on commands (section
    1),

    you could open it with `man chronyc`. Since this command supports the regular

    expression option, you can add `--regex` to use

    wildcards and other regex characters to help you narrow in your search.

- assignment: '# What is the `~` directory?


    Linux is filled with shortcuts, and learning these shortcuts

    is a crucial step to speeding up your work. One such shortcut

    is that `~` is aliased to the current user''s home directory. To test out some

    applications of this, change directories to the root directory of the system:


    `cd /`{{execute T1}}


    The `~` alias works in any case where you have to specify a path.

    If you wanted to list the contents of the _openscap_data_ subdirectory

    located in the home directory of __root__, the following command is

    valid:


    `ls ~/openscap_data`{{execute T1}}


    <pre class=file>

    eval_remediate_report.html  eval_remediate_results.xml

    </pre>


    >_NOTE:_ This is another place where you can practice tab completion.

    Typing `ls ~/op` and then pressing tab will complete the path for you

    since there is nothing else in __root__''s home directory starting

    with `op`.


    This means that running `cd ~` will always change directories to

    the home directory of the user that you are logged in as.


    `cd ~`{{execute T1}}


    You will see that your current directory has changed from


    <pre class=file>

    [root@dd2f5f5596bf /]#

    </pre>


    to


    <pre class=file>

    [root@dd2f5f5596bf ~]#

    </pre>


    >_NOTE:_ The `cd` command contains yet another shortcut, where

    running `cd` without any arguments will behave the same as

    running `cd ~`.


    Print the full path to the directory you are currently in,

    the `~` directory, using the "print working directory" command:


    `pwd`{{execute T1}}


    <pre class=file>

    /root

    </pre>


    This shows that `~` is equivalent to `/root`, the home directory

    for the __root__ user. Try the same test for a different user account

    on this system, __rhel__. Switch to __rhel__ in the second terminal

    tab:


    `su - rhel`{{execute T2}}


    Adding the `-` after `su` will automatically change directories into

    the __rhel__ user''s home directory, so print the full directory again:


    `pwd`{{execute T2}}


    <pre class=file>

    /home/rhel

    </pre>


    You can see that when logged in as __rhel__, `~` is equivalent to

    `/home/rhel`, which is the __rhel__ user''s home directory.


    >_NOTE:_ The __root__ user home directory is in a unique location,

    `/root`. All other users'' home directories will be located

    following the convention `/home/<username>`, as in the case

    of the __rhel__ user''s home directory.

- assignment: '# What is epoch time?


    Time is a fundamental part of productivity, but frameworks must be established

    to ensure that humans and computers can be on the same page about time.

    On Linux, one of these frameworks is the __unix epoch__. This is a standardized

    date and time that is defined as the beginning of time for unix systems.

    From this, an _epoch time_ (or _unix time_) is the number of seconds

    that have elapsed since the __unix epoch__. The __unix epoch__ is defined as

    Midnight UTC on January 1, 1970.


    Unix time is exceptionally well-documented online, and if you wish to learn more

    the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) on the subject is
    a great place to start.


    Now, let''s try a few examples of converting between time formats.

    The `date` command is useful for displaying the current date and time of

    your system. The value output depends on the timezone you have configured,

    and the format of the output can be controlled using format strings.


    If you run `date` without any arguments, it will print the date and time

    in the following format:


    `date`{{execute T1}}


    <pre class=file>

    Mon Aug  9 20:46:56 EDT 2021

    </pre>


    >_NOTE:_ The output should match the current date and time when you are

    running this lab, but it will be formatted using the Eastern Timezone since

    that is the default for the lab systems.


    Converting a date and time to epoch time is as simple as a single argument (`+%s`)

    with `date`. You can also specify the `-d` option to input a datetime instead
    of

    using the current one.


    `date -d "Dec 12 2014 20:00:00" +%s`{{execute T1}}


    This will show you the epoch time corresponding to the string you input:


    <pre class=file>

    1418432400

    </pre>


    You can convert in the reverse direction with `date` as well by using the `--date`

    option, then prepending a `@` symbol to the epoch time you would like to convert.

    This syntax specifies that you would like to know the date at the given epoch
    time.

    Try this using the epoch time you just received from the previous command:


    `date --date @1418432400`{{execute T1}}


    <pre class=file>

    Fri Dec 12 20:00:00 EST 2014

    </pre>


    This results in the original date that you input a few commands ago.

    Notice that this specifies the date in the timezone for this lab system,

    Eastern Time.


    For more information on using `date`, check out the [date man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html).


    An example of how you might run into unix time is available in this [SELinux troubleshooting
    article](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/selinux-denial2).

    The following example error is given:


    <pre class=file>

    type=AVC msg=audit(1600796109.687:168): avc:  denied  { read } for  pid=3912 comm="rhsmcertd-worker"
    name="virt.module" dev="dm-0" ino=50331783 scontext=system_u:system_r:rhsmcertd_t:s0
    tcontext=system_u:object_r:root_t:s0 tclass=file permissive=0

    </pre>


    For this lab, we care about the second field in this error. You may recognize

    that ten digit number as a unix timestamp. To confirm, convert it to a standard

    date:


    `date --date @1600796109`{{execute T1}}


    <pre class=file>

    Tue Sep 22 13:35:09 EDT 2020

    </pre>


    The article that this error was taken from was published on November 16, 2020,

    which supports the fact that this was a unix timestamp generated during the

    process of writing the article. However, someone who is not familiar with the

    unix time format may never consider that this number relates to time at all.
