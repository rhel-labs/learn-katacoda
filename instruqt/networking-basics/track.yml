title: Configuring Network Interfaces [Admin 101]
description: |
  # Overview:

  NetworkManager is a great tool for creating and modifying networks. This lab
  will walk you through creating your own network connection from scratch and
  modifying key parameters to control how that network connection behaves.

  You will use two terminal tabs: `host01` and `host02`. You will carry out the
  connection configuration on `host01`, and then at the end you will switch to
  `host02` to test that the connection was successfully set up.

  # Goal:

  After completing this scenario, users will be able to configure the IP, hostname,
  and DNS for a connection using `nmcli`.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Learn NetworkManager (`nmcli`) syntax
  * Configure a new dynamic IP connection using DHCP
  * Update this connection to use static IP address assignment
  * Validate and configure DNS server settings
