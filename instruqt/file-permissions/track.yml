teaser: Control access to file content using the Linux file permission system.
description: |-
  # Overview:
  It is common for multiple users to potentially have access to the same files. This means that understanding file permissions is a foundational skill for any system administrator. This lab is designed to provide you with a basic understanding of how to control who has access to various files on a system.

  # Goal:
  After completing this scenario, users will be able to read, understand, and change permissions of files and directories on their system.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Learn how to view permissions with `ls -l`
  * Explore how changing user accounts impacts interacting with files
  * Use `chmod` to change file permissions
  * Test out `chown` with example user accounts and groups
  * Learn how to use `find` to filter files based on their permissions
