title: Resolving issues with Red Hat Insights Advisor
description: "After completing this scenario, users will be able to register a system
  with\nRed Hat Insights and remediate issues that the Advisor tool has identified
  on \nthe system.\n\n# Concepts included in this scenario:\n* Register a system with
  Red Hat Insights\n* View Insights Advisor results that are reported for the system
  on cloud.redhat.com\n* Apply a recommeded remediation for the system\n* Validate
  the remediation by updating system information\n\n# Example Usecase:\nAdministrators
  want to know about problematic configurations prior to\nexperiencing problems on
  systems.  Insights Advisor will look at data\nprovided to the Advisor service and
  compare it against known problematic\nconfigurations and not only warn administrators
  through the service, but\nprovide step-by-step remediation instructions and often
  times an Ansible\nplaybook which can remediate the issue.\n\n\nFeel free to try
  out other Insights included services like Vulnerability,\nCompliance, Patch, and
  more.  We may add additional labs targeted to those\nInsights applications as well.\n"
