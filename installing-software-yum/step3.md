# Using `yum history` to roll back a transaction

The `history` subcommand provides a summary of recent `yum` transactions.

`yum history`{{execute}}

The output contains transaction IDs in the first column, which are how you reference
specific locations in the transaction history when executing rollbacks.

3 | install -y buildah       | 2021-03-11 22:21 | I, U     | 216

This subcommand is also useful for rolling back transactions if you erroneously
install or update a package, as it cleans up all of the dependencies associated
with the package. Rollback the state of your system to before you uninstalled
__httpd__:

`yum -y history rollback 6 `{{execute}}

>_NOTE:_ The number 6 here is used here to specify that the rollback
the state of the system to how it was at transaction ID 6, or before you
removed __httpd__.
You can use other relative offsets, such as `last-3`, or you can use absolute
transaction IDs. For example, `yum history rollback 2` would rollback to the
transaction where __rsync__ was installed.

This command reinstalled the RPMs that are part of __httpd__ (including
all dependencies),
restoring the system state to how it was before the previous transaction.
