# What is a package manager?

Package managers are programs which install, update, and remove software.
Doing these operations by hand would be tedious and prone to mistakes. By bundling these
functionalities into a single tool, users have a more streamlined experience.

YUM has even more utility because it performs dependency resolution whenever
it installs, removes, or updates software. The upcoming steps will give
examples of how to use YUM to streamline your package management.

# Installing a package with `yum`

Install the network analysis application Wireshark using `yum`. This application
is useful for troubleshooting network packets that are traveling in and out
of your system. This functionality is not important to this lab. This application
was picked simply because it serves as a good test subject for the upcoming examples.

`yum install -y wireshark`{{execute}}

>_Note:_ The `-y` option will automatically answer yes to any prompts during the
installation.

This installation generates a large output, so here is a high level
summary of what each section means. The first section shows all of the packages
that must be installed as dependencies for Wireshark:

<pre class=file>
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
Arch   Version         Repository                        Size

Installing dependencies:
flac-libs
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
</pre>

The next section of the output shows the total amount of memory required for the
install, and then a verification status for each dependent package. In this case,
YUM made sure that 36 other packages were up to date.

<pre class=file>
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>

Installed products updated.
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
</pre>

The final section of the output is a list of all of the packages that were
installed in support of Wireshark's installation.

<pre class=file>
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
Installed:
  flac-libs-1.3.2-9.el8.x86_64                                     
  glx-utils-8.4.0-5.20181118git1830dcb.el8.x86_64                  
  gsm-1.0.17-5.el8.x86_64  
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>

Complete!
</pre>

You can verify this installation with the `yum list` command:

`yum list wireshark`{{execute}}

<pre class=file>
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
Installed Packages
wireshark.x86_64
         1:2.6.2-12.el8 @rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
</pre>

This shows how powerful YUM is, as a single command will take care of the installation
seamlessly. Next you will see how to update and remove packages with `yum`.
