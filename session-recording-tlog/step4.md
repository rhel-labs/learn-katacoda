# Reviewing the configuration

Switch back to the Terminal in your lab environment.

As mentioned on the previous step, the Web Console actions have written a
small configuration file for sssd, 
__/etc/sssd/conf.d/sssd-session-recording.conf__  You can review it to verify 
that the scope has been set to __all__ so that
all sessions for all users and groups will be recorded.

`cat /etc/sssd/conf.d/sssd-session-recording.conf`{{execute}}

<pre class=file>
[session_recording]
scope=all
users=
groups=
</pre>

Changes to the other configuration options displayed by Web Console would have 
stored those changes in __/etc/tlog/tlog-rec-session.conf__.  For example, the
__notice__ message displayed to users who are having their session recorded.
You can inspect this file as well, if desired.

`cat /etc/tlog/tlog-rec-session.conf`{{execute}}

<pre class=file>
<<OUTPUT ABRIDGED>>

// "notice" : "\nATTENTION! Your session is being recorded!\n\n",

</pre>
